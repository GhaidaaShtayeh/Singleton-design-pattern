# SingletonDB
Singleton design pattern allows us to create one object from the class; however a customer needs to take advantage of this design pattern for class that is used to create a connection via ssh, telnet, http, scp and ftp protocols. The class should create one object for each protocol. In addition, the app can create 3 concurrent connections at most.
